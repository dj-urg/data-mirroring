            <p>
                The <strong>Data Mirroring</strong> project is designed to empower users to explore their digital presence 
                and social media interactions in a more accessible way. Many social media platforms offer Data 
                Download Packages (DDPs), which are often complex and not easily understood by non-technical users. 
                This application converts those DDPs from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube into easy-to-read tables, 
                graphs, and summaries. The goal is to help users better understand their digital behavior, providing 
                a tool for reflection on time spent online, interactions, and content consumption patterns.
