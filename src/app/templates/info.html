            This project helps users reflect on their social media usage by transforming platform data 
            into insightful visualizations. By uploading your data from platforms like TikTok, Instagram, 
            and YouTube, you can see how your interactions and activities unfold over time.

        <!-- About the Project Section -->
        <h2 class="mt-5">About the Project</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            The <strong>Data Mirroring</strong> project is designed to empower users to explore their digital presence 
            and social media interactions in a more accessible way. Many social media platforms offer Data 
            Download Packages (DDPs), which are often complex and not easily understood by non-technical users. 
            This application converts those DDPs from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube into easy-to-read tables, 
            graphs, and summaries. The goal is to help users better understand their digital behavior, providing 
            a tool for reflection on time spent online, interactions, and content consumption patterns.
