## 🌐 Overview

**Data Mirroring** is a research project developed by Daniel Jurg, Sarah Vis, and Ike Picone at **imec-SMIT, Vrije Universiteit Brussel** as part of the NUSE-Unit.

This Flask-based web application empowers social media users to:

- **Understand their digital footprint** by converting complex JSON files from Data Download Packages (DDPs) into readable CSV formats
- **Visualize their activity patterns** through interactive charts and heatmaps
- **Prepare data for donation** by removing sensitive information while maintaining analytical value
- **Export processed data** for further analysis in external tools

### Key Principles

🔒 **Privacy-First Design**: All data is processed in-memory or as temporary files during your session and automatically deleted afterward. No user data is retained on the server.

🎯 **User Empowerment**: Designed to help users reflect on their social media usage patterns and make informed decisions about their digital presence.

📊 **Research-Oriented**: Built to facilitate data donation for academic research while respecting user privacy and GDPR compliance.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality

- **Multi-File Upload**: Process multiple JSON files simultaneously from your DDP
- **Data Transformation**: Convert complex nested JSON structures into clean, tabular CSV format
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Generate charts, heatmaps, and timeline visualizations
- **Export Options**: Download processed data as CSV or Excel files for further analysis
- **Data Sanitization**: Automatically remove sensitive information before export

### Platform-Specific Processing

- **YouTube**: Watch history, search history, comments, and engagement patterns
- **Instagram**: Posts, stories, messages, and interaction analytics
- **TikTok**: Video history, likes, comments, and browsing behavior
- **Netflix**: Viewing history and watch patterns

### Security & Privacy Features

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All traffic encrypted in production
- **CSRF Protection**: Secure form submissions with token validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Access Control**: Authentication required for all sensitive routes
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Session-based temporary file management
- **Security Headers**: CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, and more

### Technical Features

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13** or higher (Python 3.8+ may work but is not officially supported)
- **pip** package manager
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized deployment)
- **Git** for cloning the repository

### Installation

#### Option 1: Local Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dj-urg/data-mirroring.git
   cd data-mirroring
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Option 2: Docker Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dj-urg/data-mirroring.git
   cd data-mirroring
   ```
2. **Build and run with Docker Compose**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

### Configuration

Before running the application, you must configure environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
# Required: Secret key for session management (use a strong random string)
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here

# Required: Access code for authentication
ACCESS_CODE=your-access-code-here

# Optional: Environment mode (development or production)
FLASK_ENV=development

# Optional: Port number (default: 5001)
PORT=5001

# Optional: CORS allowed origins (comma-separated)
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://data-mirror-72f6ffc87917.herokuapp.com
```

**Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. Use strong, randomly generated values for `SECRET_KEY` and `ACCESS_CODE` in production.

**Linux/macOS**

```bash
export SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
export ACCESS_CODE=your-access-code-here
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

**Windows (Command Prompt)**

```cmd
set SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
set ACCESS_CODE=your-access-code-here
set FLASK_ENV=development
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
$env:SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
$env:ACCESS_CODE="your-access-code-here"
$env:FLASK_ENV="development"
```

</details>

### Running the Application

#### Local Development

```bash
python src/app.py
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:5001` by default.

#### Production with Gunicorn

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5001 'src.app:create_app()'
```

#### Custom Port

```bash
PORT=8080 python src/app.py
```

## 💡 Usage

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access the Application**

   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5001`
   - Enter the access code you configured in the `.env` file
2. **Select Platform**

   - Choose the social media platform (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, or Netflix)
3. **Upload Data Files**

   - Click "Choose Files" and select JSON files from your DDP
   - You can upload multiple files at once (max 16MB per file)
4. **View Results**

   - The application will process your data and display:
     - Summary statistics
     - Interactive visualizations
     - Data preview tables
5. **Export Data**

   - Download processed data as CSV or Excel
   - All sensitive information is automatically removed

### Obtaining Your Data Download Package

Each platform has a different process for requesting your data:

- **YouTube/Google**: [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/)
- **Instagram**: Settings → Security → Download Data
- **TikTok**: Settings → Privacy → Download your data
- **Netflix**: Account → Download your personal information

> **Processing Time**: DDPs can take several days to be prepared by the platform. File sizes vary from a few MB to several GB depending on your activity.
