## Overview
Welcome to the Data Mirroring research project, developed by Daniel Jurg, Sarah Vis, and Ike Picone at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel as part of the NUSE-Unit. This project aims to facilitate user reflection on social media usage through data conversion and visualization. The application transforms specific files in Data Download Packages (DDPs) provided by social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube into a more human-readable format. By processing a subset of the DDPs, the application offers social media users insights into their data while also ensuring the removal of parts of the data that might contain sensitive information before possible data donation. Uploaded data, CSVs, and generated visualization are processed in-memory or saved as temporary files during your session and deleted after use of the app. While the Data Mirroring application provides initial insights into data, it is designed to export social media data in tabular format for further processing in other tools.

## Features
- **Platform Selection**: Choose between YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok for data processing.
- **File Upload**: Upload multiple JSON files for each platform.
- **Data Processing**: Generates insights and visualizations from uploaded platform data.
- **Download CSV**: After processing, you can download a CSV file of the results.

## Installation
**Step 1:** Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dj-urg/data-mirroring.git
cd data-mirroring
```

**Step 2:** Install dependencies  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 3:** Run the application  
```bash
python app.py
```

## Configuration
Before running the application, set the required environment variables:

**Linux/macOS (Terminal)**
```bash
export SECRET_KEY=test
export ACCESS_CODE=test
export FLASK_ENV=development
```

**Windows (Command Prompt)**

```bash
set SECRET_KEY=test
set ACCESS_CODE=test
set FLASK_ENV=development
```

Or create a .env file and add:

```bash
SECRET_KEY=example
ACCESS_CODE=example
FLASK_ENV=development
```

## Usage
Once you've run the application, simply navigate to the local port:
```bash
http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Python, CSS, Dockerfile, HTML, JavaScript
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Other Tools:** Docker, Github Actions

## Security & Best Practices
- Use environment variables instead of hardcoding secrets.
- Follow GitHub security updates for dependencies.
