            At Data Mirroring, we prioritize the privacy and security of your data. This page outlines how we process your data when you use our service hosted on Heroku.

        <h2 class="mt-5">Coding for Privacy</h2>
        <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
            This app is designed to keep your data secure. When you upload a file, it’s stored in a temporary location that only you can access through your session. 
            This means that no one else can download or view your files. Once you download your processed data, the file is automatically deleted to keep your information safe. The app also uses secure connections (HTTPS) to protect your data while you're using it, and it only allows specific, safe file types to be uploaded. 
            In short, your data is handled carefully, and it's deleted after you’ve downloaded it, ensuring your privacy throughout.
