        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            This project aims to facilitate user reflection on social media usage through data 
            conversion and visualization. The application transforms Data Download Packages 
            (DDPs) provided by social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube into 
            a more human-readable format.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Use the Application</h2>
        <p>
            To use the application, select a platform from the dashboard, upload your data, 
            and explore the visualizations and insights generated from your data.
